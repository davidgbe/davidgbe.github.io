            <p>I am a PhD student in the physics department at the University of Washington in Seattle.</p>
            <p>I most recently worked for <a href="https://applaudmedical.com/">Applaud Medical</a> in San Francisco, developing a therapy for urinary stones based on bubbles and ultrasound. Before that, I obtained a BS in physics at the University of Southern California. </p>
            <p>While at university, I interned at a series of software companies in college, including <a href="https://www.change.org/">Change.org</a> and <a href="https://joinhomebase.com/">Homebase</a>, which eventually informed an interest in computational work. I was also part of the founding team of <a href="https://www.ctcusc.com/">Code the Change</a> at USC.</p>

        <h2> Ponderings </h1>
        <p style="padding: 0 20px 20px 20px; margin: 0;">I am fascinated by a host of topics, from physics, mathematics, neuroscience, machine learning, and programming to music, swimming, and literature. Like many researchers, I have the ultimate goal of understanding the brain and creating intelligence on a non-biological substrate.</p>

            </a>
            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">There are many parallels between statistical physics and machine learning, but it surprised me quite a bit to see the formalism I'd studied in stat mech turn up in pre-training methods for neural networks. Over the winter of my senior year, I spent time exploring the mechanics of RBMs.</p>

            <p style="padding-left: 20px;">With Lucas Johnson from USC, I attempted to reproduce the <a href="https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.114.096405">machine learning-aided molecular dynamics described by Zhenwei, et al.</a> A Guassian Process was used to directly infer inter-atomic forces from rotationally and translationally invariant representations of arrangements of atoms.
